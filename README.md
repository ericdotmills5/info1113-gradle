## Source Code

The source code for the game is organized as follows:

- Game code: `project\src\main\java\WizardTD`
- Test cases: `project\src\test\java\WizardTD`

You can view the coverage of the test cases in the following file: `project\reports\jacoco\test\html\index.html`

## Gameplay

The aim of WizardTD is to survive all the waves of monsters by preventing them from reaching the wizard tower and draining all your mana. You can do this by placing and upgrading towers.

Controls are presented within the game. You can either click buttons on the right tab or press the respective keyboard key displayed on the button.

Enjoy the game and happy defending!
