This repository contains a tower defence game I created to learn java, and objected oriented programming with.

To play this game, download the "project" folder and run the "launch.jre" executable.

The source code for the game can be found in the folder: project\src\main\java\WizardTD
The source code for the test cases can be found in the folder: project\src\test\java\WizardTD
The coverage of the test cases can be found in the file: project\reports\jacoco\test\html\index.html

The controls are presented within the game as either clickable buttons on the right tab, or by pressing the respective keyboard key displayed on the button.
The aim is to survive all of the waves by preventing the monsters from draining all your mana by reaching the wizard tower.
